```
. Here are two old writing samples.
. These are successful grants written for the Alaska Space Grant program, a NASA funded enterprise.
. At the time, I was deeply involved in the UAA plasma physics laboratory.
. So the topics of these proposals have to do with experimental plasma physics.
. Planeterrella Proposal, date == Summer 2016.
. Helicon Proposal, date == Fall 2016.
. I regret not making these proposals double-column; please forgive the cognitive strain.
. The Helicon proposal was awarded, but due to a medical complication, I could not perform the work and returned funding.
. The Planeterrella proposal was awarded, and work was completed on schedule.
