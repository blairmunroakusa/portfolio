This folder is just for fun, harking back to younger days.

. I was the owner operator of 'Snow Shark Plowing Services, LLC' for one year.
. I managed 30 residential clients, and two commercial clients.
. I taught myself automotive mechanics and did all my repairs,
	( except for the time my transmission blew out; I don't mess with transmissions )
. Snow Shark Plowing Services taught me,
	. it is best to have a million dollar (minimum) idea before going into business.
. I had a lot of fun though, and I made a ton of money.
. The snow shark was an 88 K5 blazer that was a beast and super fun to drive.
. In the end, I sold the business and moved on, back to school.
