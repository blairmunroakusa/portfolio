NORTHERN LIGHTS SIMULATOR README

```
. The following are pictures of a northern lights simulator.
. I won a grant to build this during my undergraduate days in a Plasma Physics Lab at UAA.
. Design inspired by plans from Jean Lilensten, Institut de Planétologie et d’Astrophysique de Grenoble.
. Device fabricated with help of UAA machinist Corbin Rowe
. The simulator is a DC glow discharge plasma source,
. housed in a medium/high vacuum chamber.

. I plan to make my own someday when I am idle enough.
. I want to produce a similar design that is cheap enough for average people to afford.
( thinking pyrex tupperware, cookie pans, and medical grade vacuum pump )
