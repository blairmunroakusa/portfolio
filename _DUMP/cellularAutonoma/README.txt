. OK, linear cellular automata (as opposed to Conway's Game of Life) are cells arranged in a straight line.
.. Cell 'lines' evolve over time.
.. Each cell line element depends on the values of the previous generation's local cell element values.
... EG, we may impose rule that cell ON requires all three local cells in previous generation be ON.
.. Each cell basically acts as a stupid-simple computer.
. We find that cellular automata simulations produce complex results with simple rules.
.. See work done by Stephen Wolfram, from 'A New Kind of Science'
