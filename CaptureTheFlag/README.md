### Capture The Flag Javascripts

For an interview, I was tasked to create an exploit to rob an imaginary token lender on the Ethereum blockchain. At the request of the company I was interviewing for, I withheld the Solidity contract sourcecode that I was exploiting and the corresponding ABIs. All in all, I stole about 65,000 imaginary dollars worth of ether.

After running the setup javascript, the shell script would clean house.
