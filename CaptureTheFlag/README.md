### Capture The Flag Javascripts

For an interview, I was tasked to create an exploit to rob an imaginary token lender on the Ethereum blockchain. At the request of the company I was interviewing for, I withheld the Solidity contract sourcecode that I was exploiting and the corresponding ABIs. All in all, I stole about 65,000 imaginary dollars worth of ether. It was quite the take, and by far the largest imaginary steal I've pulled off.

After running the setup javascript, the shell script would clean house.

I probably could have done thing more elegantly, but I was most concerned about getting the job done.
